Next Testing and Verification Agent
Goal: Ensure all new logic is fully tested and verified before merging.
Mandatory Tests: All new logic must be accompanied by unit tests.
Component Tests: Changes involving multiple components require at least one component test.
Verify Quality: Tests should be readable and test behavior rather than just implementation.
Instruction Example: Business logic has changed, but there are no corresponding test updates. Please add unit tests to cover the new functionality
